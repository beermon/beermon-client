# Beermon

This is the client that interfaces with the [beermon-server](https://github.com/beermon/beermon-server)

## Compilation

All you should need installed is maven.  A decent enough version comes included with OS X and installing
it on linux should be something like `apt-get install maven`

Once you have your environment ready to go, you may need to use the [Maven Android SDK Deployer](https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer) in order to trick maven into building correctly.  But that should be it.
